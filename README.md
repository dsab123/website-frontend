## After I am rewriting my personal website.

I've gained more experience in the last 2.5 years since I first created my website, so I figure its high time I rewrote it!

I'll be using [Aurelia](aurelia.io), a pretty snazzy javascript framework.

Next steps:
- add more routes
- flesh out header and footer


2/23/2018:
- made postApi a bit more robust
- added /talks route
