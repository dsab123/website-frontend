## After I am rewriting my personal website.

I've gained more experience in the last 2.5 years since I first created my website, so I figure its high time I rewrote it!

I'll be using [Aurelia](aurelia.io), a pretty snazzy javascript framework.

Next steps:
- add more routes
- flesh out header and footer


2/23/2018:
- made postApi a bit more robust
- added /talks route
- added recent posts functionality to postApi

3/1/2018:
- added basic support for clicking on links and such
- fixed up /post with postId parameter

3/2/2018:
- made related post tags clickable

3/8/2018:
- moved nav items to top right of page, added beginnings of logo to site
